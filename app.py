EXPERT_MEETING_DETAILED_PROMPT = """### **PRIMARY DIRECTIVE: MAXIMUM DETAIL & STRICT COMPLETENESS**
Your goal is to produce the most thorough, granular notes possible. Remove conversational filler ("um," "you know," repetition) but **nothing substantive should be omitted.** Every factual claim, example, explanation, aside, and data point in the transcript must appear in your notes. When in doubt, INCLUDE it. Err heavily on the side of over-inclusion. Longer, more detailed notes are always preferred over concise ones.

### **NOTES STRUCTURE**

**(1.) Opening overview or Expert background (Conditional):**
- If the transcript chunk begins with an overview, agenda, or expert intro, include it FIRST as bullet points.
- **DO:** Capture ALL details (names, dates, numbers, titles, affiliations, years of experience, roles). Use simple, direct language.
- **DO NOT:** Summarize or include introductions about consulting firms.
- If no intro exists, OMIT this section entirely.

**(2.) Q&A format:**
Structure the main body STRICTLY in Question/Answer format.

**(2.A) Questions:**
-   Identify the core question being asked and rephrase it clearly in **bold**. Do NOT copy the question verbatim from the transcript — clean up filler, false starts, and rambling phrasing into a clear, well-formed question that preserves the original intent.
-   **NO LABELS:** Do NOT prefix questions with "Q:", "Q.", "Question:", or any similar label. The bold question text stands alone.
-   If the questioner provides context, framing, or a multi-part question, capture the full scope — do not reduce a multi-part question to a single line.
-   **LONG QUESTIONS / PREAMBLE:** Sometimes a question is long because the interviewer provides substantial framing, background, or context before asking — this preamble is part of the question and must be preserved as part of the bold question text. Do NOT treat the preamble as part of the answer.
-   **SPACING:** Leave exactly one blank line between the end of one answer and the start of the next bold question, so each Q&A pair is visually separated.

**(2.B) Answers:**
-   Use bullet points (`-`) directly below the question (no blank line between the bold question and its first bullet).
-   Each bullet point must convey specific factual information in a clear, complete sentence.
-   Use **multiple bullet points** per answer — do NOT collapse a detailed response into a single bullet.
-   **ZERO SKIPPING RULE:** If the expert said it with substance, it must appear in your notes. Do NOT skip examples, anecdotes, specific sentences, or supporting details even if they seem minor or repetitive. Every distinct point gets its own bullet. If an answer contains 8 substantive points, you must produce at least 8 bullets — never condense them into 3-4.
-   **PRIORITY #1: CAPTURE ALL HARD DATA.** This includes all names, examples, monetary values (`$`), percentages (`%`), metrics, specific entities mentioned, time periods, market sizes, growth rates, company names, product names, and geographies.
-   **PRIORITY #2: CAPTURE ALL NUANCE & REASONING.** Do not over-summarize or reduce complex answers to surface-level statements. You must retain the following:
    -   **Sentiment & Tone:** Note if the expert is confident, uncertain, speculative, cautious, or enthusiastic (e.g., "The expert was highly confident that...," "He cautioned that...").
    -   **Qualifiers & Conditions:** Preserve modifying words that change meaning (e.g., "usually," "in most cases," "except in," "only when," "roughly," "approximately," "a potential risk is...").
    -   **Key Examples & Analogies:** If the expert uses a specific example, anecdote, case study, or analogy to illustrate a point, capture it in full, even if it spans multiple sentences — these are often the most valuable parts of an expert call.
    -   **Cause & Effect:** Retain any reasoning chains provided (e.g., "...because of regulatory changes," "...which led to a 15% decline in...").
    -   **Comparisons & Contrasts:** If the expert compares companies, products, approaches, or time periods, capture both sides of the comparison with the specific details for each.
    -   **Tangential but relevant points:** If the expert volunteers additional context, background, or related information beyond the direct question, include it — do NOT discard it as off-topic.
-   **PRIORITY #3: PRESERVE MULTI-STEP EXPLANATIONS.** If an answer involves a sequence of steps, a timeline, or a logical chain, preserve the full sequence rather than summarizing the conclusion only."""

4.  **NO META-COMMENTARY:** NEVER produce statements about the transcript itself, such as "the transcript does not contain an answer," "no relevant information in this section," "the chunk starts mid-conversation," or similar. If a chunk begins mid-answer, capture that content as a continuation of the relevant section. Always extract and document whatever substantive content exists.
5.  **MID-CHUNK STARTS:** If the chunk starts in the middle of a response, begin your notes by capturing that content under the most relevant heading from context. Do not skip or discard partial content.
6.  **MAINTAIN OUTPUT VOLUME:** This chunk contains the same amount of content as the first chunk. Your output for this chunk MUST be equally detailed and equally long. Do NOT produce a shorter or more condensed output just because this is a continuation. If the first chunk produced 30 bullet points, this chunk should produce a similar number.

**MEETING TRANSCRIPT (NEW CHUNK):**
{chunk_text}
"""

VALIDATION_DETAILED_PROMPT = """You are a rigorous Transcript Completeness Auditor performing a fact-by-fact audit of processed meeting notes against the source transcript.

## INPUTS

### FULL PROCESSED NOTES (complete — for reference when checking missing content):
{full_notes}

### PORTION TO ANNOTATE ({chunk_info}):
{chunk_to_annotate}

### SOURCE TRANSCRIPT (Ground Truth):
{transcript}

## CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING

Notes are always paraphrased and restructured versions of the transcript — this is intentional and CORRECT. You must NEVER flag paraphrasing, rephrasing, reorganisation, or compression as errors. The note-taking AI's job is to restructure, not transcribe verbatim.

**Cross-chunk context:** The FULL PROCESSED NOTES above contain all Q&As from this call. When checking for missing content, check the FULL NOTES — if a piece of transcript content is captured *anywhere* in the full notes (even outside the PORTION TO ANNOTATE), do NOT flag it as missing.

## WHAT TO FIND — BE RIGOROUS

**1. MISSING CONTENT** (most important — go fact by fact)

Walk through the TRANSCRIPT systematically, exchange by exchange. For each expert response, check the FULL NOTES for every one of the following:

- **Every specific number, percentage, monetary value, metric, or growth rate** — even a single missing figure is a gap
- **Every named entity** — companies, people, product names, geographies, regulatory bodies, specific time periods
- **Every distinct example, anecdote, or case study** the expert used to illustrate a point — these are high-value and frequently dropped
- **Every qualifier or hedge that changes meaning** — "roughly," "typically," "only in certain cases," "except when," "approximately," "we think," "possibly" — omitting these alters the meaning materially
- **Every distinct reasoning chain or cause-effect link** — e.g., "because X, Y happened, which led to Z"
- **Every comparison or contrast** — if the expert compared two companies, sectors, or time periods, check both sides are captured
- **Every explicitly stated uncertainty or caveat** — if the expert said they were unsure, speculating, or hedging, that tone must be preserved

Only flag as MISSING if the fact, name, number, or nuance genuinely does not appear anywhere in the FULL NOTES.

**2. MISREPRESENTATION** (apply sparingly but precisely)

Content in the PORTION TO ANNOTATE that factually contradicts or distorts the transcript:
- Wrong number (transcript: 30%, notes: 20%)
- Wrong direction (transcript: declining, notes: growing)
- Wrong entity name or wrong speaker attribution
- Expert expressed uncertainty but notes state it as established fact, or vice versa
- A "could" or "might" in the transcript rendered as a definitive claim in the notes

**3. REPEATED Q&A** (check the FULL NOTES)

Scan the FULL PROCESSED NOTES for Q&A pairs that cover substantially the same question or repeat the same answer content. This happens when chunked note generation produces near-duplicate sections due to transcript overlap. Flag as repeated if:
- Two bold questions ask essentially the same thing (even if worded differently)
- An answer block appears twice with the same or very similar bullet points
- A topic or data point is covered in near-identical language in two separate Q&A pairs

## WHAT NOT TO FLAG

- Paraphrasing → CORRECT
- Restructuring or reordering → CORRECT
- Compression where key facts are still present → CORRECT
- Filler, false starts, rambling clean-up → CORRECT
- Minor synonym substitutions that preserve meaning → CORRECT
- A topic mentioned briefly in one Q&A and fully covered in another → NOT a repeat (only flag true duplicates)

## ANNOTATIONS — THREE TYPES ONLY

Do NOT use any markup other than these three exact formats.

**MISSING CONTENT** — insert immediately after the Q&A pair in the PORTION TO ANNOTATE where the gap is most relevant:
`<div style="background:#fef9c3;border-left:3px solid #ca8a04;padding:5px 10px;margin:6px 0;font-size:0.88em;color:#78350f">⚠️ <strong>Missing:</strong> [quote or precisely describe the specific fact, number, name, qualifier, or example from the transcript that is absent from the full notes]</div>`

**MISREPRESENTATION** — wrap only the specific wrong text, immediately followed by an inline correction:
`<del style="color:#dc2626">the wrong text as it appears in the notes</del><span style="color:#16a34a;font-size:0.9em"> → [what the transcript actually says]</span>`

**REPEATED Q&A** — insert immediately before the duplicate bold question in the PORTION TO ANNOTATE:
`<div style="background:#ede9fe;border-left:3px solid #7c3aed;padding:5px 10px;margin:6px 0;font-size:0.88em;color:#5b21b6">🔁 <strong>Duplicate:</strong> This Q&A substantially repeats [describe which earlier Q&A it duplicates and what the overlapping content is]</div>`

**Correct content** — leave exactly as-is. No annotation whatsoever.

## OUTPUT

Output ONLY the annotated PORTION TO ANNOTATE, preserving its exact structure (bold questions, bullet points, spacing). Do NOT output the full notes section, and do NOT add any summary, preamble, footer, or meta-commentary of any kind."""

Convert the detailed meeting notes below into a short, plain-text research note.

### STYLE (follow exactly):

1. TITLE: A short, natural title on the first line. Examples: "Channel checks on Quick commerce", "Checks on Hero Motocorp", "Hero demand checks". Keep it simple — no formatting, no colons.

2. INTRO: One sentence starting with "We spoke with..." describing who you spoke with (role/expertise, NOT their name) and what you wanted to understand. Then on the same line or next: "Following were the KTAs:"

3. BODY: Write 4-7 short paragraphs of plain flowing text. Each paragraph makes one clear point.
   - ABSOLUTELY NO markdown formatting. No bold (**), no bullets (-), no numbered lists, no headers (#). Just plain text paragraphs.
   - Use simple, direct language. Write like you're sending a quick note to your team, not writing a formal report.
   - Attribute findings to the source naturally: "The expert estimates...", "She didn't share...", "Dealers felt...", "Managers mentioned...", "Our checks highlight...", "He pointed out..."
   - Weave in your own analyst commentary where relevant: "We will need to monitor...", "This makes it tricky because...", "We have observed earlier that..."

4. TONE: {tone}
   - Very Positive: Frame findings constructively. Strengths, growth, advantages. Challenges are temporary.
   - Positive: Generally constructive. Risks acknowledged but opportunities emphasized.
   - Neutral: Balanced. Facts presented objectively.
   - Negative: Risks and structural problems emphasized. Positive developments are insufficient.
   - Very Negative: Fundamental weaknesses, unsustainable practices. Deeply problematic framing.

3. **Business Structure & Organization** — How is the business organized (segments, divisions, subsidiaries)? Any restructuring, new segments, or organizational changes?
4. **Leadership & Governance** — Board composition changes, key management changes, succession planning, governance structure evolution?
5. **Incentive Structures & Compensation** — How are executives compensated? What metrics drive bonuses/ESOPs? Any changes in incentive design?
6. **Risk Factors & Mitigation** — What risks are highlighted? How has the risk landscape changed? New risks vs. dropped risks?
7. **Capital Allocation Philosophy** — How does management talk about deploying capital? Dividends vs. buybacks vs. reinvestment priorities?
8. **ESG / Sustainability** — Environmental, social, governance initiatives. How prominent is ESG in the narrative? Any new commitments?
9. **Market & Competitive Positioning** — How does the company describe its competitive position? Market share commentary, moats, differentiation?
10. **Growth Levers & Outlook** — What growth avenues are highlighted? Organic vs. inorganic? Geographic vs. product expansion?
11. **Culture & People** — Employee-related commentary, talent strategy, culture statements, DEI initiatives?
12. **Technology & Digital** — Digital transformation initiatives, technology investments, IT strategy evolution?

You are an expert analyst comparing annual reports from different years for the same company. Below are the qualitative extractions from each year's report. Your task is to produce a structured comparison highlighting what has CHANGED, what has STAYED THE SAME, and what is NEW or DROPPED.

### COMPANY: {company_name}

### EXTRACTED DATA FROM EACH REPORT:

1. **What changed?** — Shifts in tone, emphasis, strategy, structure, or policy between years.
2. **What remained consistent?** — Themes or approaches that persisted across years.
3. **What is new?** — Themes, initiatives, or structural elements that appear in later reports but not earlier ones.
4. **What was dropped?** — Items emphasized in earlier reports but absent or de-emphasized in later ones.

1. Be SPECIFIC — cite which year said what. Use phrases like "In FY2022, management emphasized X, while in FY2024, the focus shifted to Y."
2. Include direct management quotes where they illustrate a meaningful shift.
3. Do NOT simply list what each year said — actually COMPARE and CONTRAST.
4. Highlight the most SIGNIFICANT shifts prominently. Minor changes can be noted briefly.
5. If a dimension shows no meaningful change across years, say so explicitly — consistency is also a finding.
6. Order the comparison chronologically (earliest to latest year).
